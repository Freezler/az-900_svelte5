			<li>
				<strong>Scalability:</strong> The ability to scale, so allocate and deallocate resources at any

			<li><strong>Elasticity:</strong> The ability to scale dynamically.</li>
			<li><strong>Agility:</strong> The ability to react fast (scale quickly).</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Fault Tolerance:</strong> The ability to maintain system uptime while physical and service
				component failures happen.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Disaster Recovery:</strong> The process and design principle which allows a system to
				recover from natural or human-induced disasters.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>High Availability:</strong> The agreed level of operational uptime for the system. It
				is a simple calculation of system uptime versus the whole lifetime of the system: availability
				= uptime / (uptime + downtime).
