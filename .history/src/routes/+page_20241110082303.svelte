	<p>Cloud Computing Service delivery model over the internet (cloud). This includes, but is not limited to, compute power, meaning servers such as Windows, Linux, hosting environments, etc.; storage like files and/or databases; networking in Azure but also outside when connecting to your company network; and analytics services for visualization and telemetry data.</p>

	<p><strong>Key concepts:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Scalability:</strong> The ability to scale, so allocate and deallocate resources at any time.</li>
		<li><strong>Elasticity:</strong> The ability to scale dynamically.</li>
		<li><strong>Agility:</strong> The ability to react fast (scale quickly).</li>
		<li><strong>Fault Tolerance:</strong> The ability to maintain system uptime while physical and service component failures happen.</li>
		<li><strong>Disaster Recovery:</strong> The process and design principle which allows a system to recover from natural or human-induced disasters.</li>

		storage like files and/or databases networking in azure but also outside when connecting to your
		company network analytics services for visualization and telemetry data Key concepts scalability
		is the ability to scale, so allocate and deallocate resources at any time elasticity is the
		ability to scale dynamically agility is the ability to react fast (scale quickly) fault
		tolerance is the ability to maintain system uptime while physical and service component failures
		happen disaster recovery is the process and design principle which allows a system to recovers
		from natural or human induced disasters high availability is the agreed level of operational
		uptime for the system. It is a simple calculation of system uptime versus whole lifetime of the
		system. availability = uptime/(uptime + downtime)
